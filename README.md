# D365 F&O Code Review Workspace

A comprehensive workspace for conducting Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations (D365 F&O) architecture reviews and code analysis using Azure DevOps integration and AI-powered code review capabilities.

## 🎯 Overview

This workspace provides a structured environment for D365 F&O developers and architects to perform thorough code reviews, architectural analysis, and compliance validation against Microsoft best practices. It integrates with Azure DevOps to streamline the review process and leverage AI assistance for comprehensive analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI-Powered Code Reviews**: Leverages GitHub Copilot with specialized D365 F&O expertise
- **Azure DevOps Integration**: Direct integration with Azure DevOps for build analysis and changeset reviews
- **Architecture Compliance**: Automated checks against D365 F&O best practices and patterns
- **Security Analysis**: Comprehensive security review capabilities for X++ code
- **Performance Assessment**: Tools for analyzing performance implications of code changes

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using this workspace, ensure you have:

- **Visual Studio Code** with the following extensions:
  - GitHub Copilot
  - Model Context Protocol (MCP) support
- **Azure DevOps Access**: Valid personal access token with appropriate permissions
- **Python 3.13+** for running the Azure DevOps tools
- **uvx** package manager for Python tools

## 🛠️ Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd d365-fo-code-reviews
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure your Azure DevOps settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file with your Azure DevOps configuration:

```bash
DEVOPS_ORGANIZATION=your_organization
DEVOPS_PROJECT=your_project
DEVOPS_PAT=your_personal_access_token
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

The workspace uses `uvx` to manage Python dependencies. The Azure DevOps tools will be automatically installed when first used.

### 4. Configure VS Code

The workspace is pre-configured with Model Context Protocol (MCP) settings. Ensure GitHub Copilot is installed and authenticated.

## 🔍 Usage

### Conducting Code Reviews

The workspace provides specialized AI assistance for D365 F&O code reviews. Simply:

1. Open any X++ file or AOT object
2. Use GitHub Copilot to analyze code with D365 F&O specific context
3. Generate comprehensive review reports following the structured guidelines

### Azure DevOps Integration

Access Azure DevOps data directly from VS Code:

- **Build Analysis**: Review build logs and identify failures
- **Changeset Review**: Analyze code changes and their impact
- **Pipeline Monitoring**: Track build pipelines and their status

### Architecture Review Process

Follow the structured review process defined in the Copilot instructions:

1. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - X++ language standards validation
   - AOT structure review
   - Performance pattern analysis

2. **Security Review**
   - Role-based access control validation
   - Data protection compliance
   - Security implementation patterns

3. **Integration Analysis**
   - API design review
   - Data entity validation
   - External system integration patterns

## 🔧 Configuration

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The workspace uses MCP to integrate Azure DevOps tools. Configuration is in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
    "servers": {
        "azuredevops-tools": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "uvx",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "${workspaceFolder}",
                "azuredevops-tools"
            ],
            "envFile": "${workspaceFolder}/.env"
        }
    }
}
```
